# TypeScript OOP Example

This project provides a simple example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript. It develops an API that includes concepts of customers, products, and orders. The project involves TypeScript and a basic Node.js application.

## Getting Started

To use the project, you can follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js must be installed.
- TypeScript compiler must be installed (you can install it globally with the command `npm install -g typescript` if needed).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Yesarib/Typescript-OOP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Typescript-OOP
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

After the project is set up, you can follow these steps:

1. Compile the TypeScript code:

    ```bash
    tsc
    ```

2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. The application will run through the console, simulating various customer, product, and order operations.
   Use api end-points while the project is running.  
   Note: Since the project runs in the console, running it again will delete the previous data.
